Hello there, I am Sander Hageman.

Currently I am a fourth year game programming student at the NHTV in Breda. I started programming when I was about 10 years old using Game Maker. In 2014 I went to the NHTV to study International Game Architecture and Design to learn more about making games. At the NHTV I learned about AAA game development and how to work in teams in varying sizes up to 30 people.
