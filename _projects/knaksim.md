The game and source can be found on the [Global Game Jam website](https://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/glorious-knakworst-simulator)

## My Contributions
* __Simulating Knakworst Physics__
  * The floppy 'physics' of a sausage are not found or simulated easily so we had to search a bit for a solution. Eventually we figured out how to use the Unity built-in cloth-simulation to get it somewhat correct.
* __Setup of Source Control__
  * The internet at the location we were at had a really unstable internetconnection so we had to setup our own source control, SVN seemed the easiest solution for such a short project.
