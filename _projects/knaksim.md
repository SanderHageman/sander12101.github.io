contributions:
  - name: Simulating Knakworst Physics
    shortdesc: Emulation of 'floppy' physics
    desc: The floppy 'physics' of a sausage are not found or simulated easily so we had to search a bit for a solution. Eventually we figured out how to use the Unity built-in cloth-simulation to get it somewhat correct.
  - name: Setup of Source Control
    shortdesc: Setting up SVN
    desc: The internet at the location we were at was really unstable and slow so we had to setup our own source control for better and more rapid development, SVN seemed the easiest solution for such a short project.
