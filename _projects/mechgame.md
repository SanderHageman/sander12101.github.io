## Description
{{ page.info }} The player controls the game using three peripherals: the Razor Hydra, an occulus rift, and a mechanical set of paddles. The Hydra controls the arms and weapons of the Mech and the pedals are used for the movement of the legs.

## My Contributions
* __Implementation of Occulus Rift__
  * I implemented support for the Occulus Rift.
* __Implementation of Razor Hydra__
  * I implemented support for the Razor Hydra which at the time had already been discontinued.
* __Implementation of inverse kinematics__
  * I implemented support for inverse kinematics to be able to correctly control the arms of the mech as realistically as possible. This can be viewed [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-OfPg-s0TE).
