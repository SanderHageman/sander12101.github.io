contributions:
  - name: Special Attack
    shortdesc: Added the Special Attack for full rage meter
    desc: Implemented the Special attack the player can execute when their 'rage-meter' is filled. For this to work correctly I had to implement a slowmotion, the possiblity to select enemies by clicking on them with either the mouse or the touchscreen, creating particles, and importing and applying the correct animations.
  - name: Importing Animations
    shortdesc: Importing and applying animations
    desc: For the special attack I had to import and apply the correct animations for each phase in the special attack.
  - name: Ranged weapon
    shortdesc: Create a gun with variable ammo-types

## Description
{{ page.info }} The game has various pickups to help you; rapid fire, health and armour packs. Every time the player hits an enemy they build a rage meter. Once that is full they can unleash a series of precise blows which kill all enemies in a certain radius.

You can view the trailer [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vihaGfsV1GQ).

The game was also shown at GDC 2016.
