## My Contributions
* __Playstation 4__
  * During the development of the game I was responsible for making the game compatible with the PS4. This included making modifications to the UE4 source and extensive use of the PS4 development tools.
  
* __Prototyping__
  * At the start of the project I was involved with rapidly prototyping a multitude of mechanics.
