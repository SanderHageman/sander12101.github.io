## Description
{{ page.info }}

## My Contributions
* __Setup of dynamic room-system__
  * Because of the limited hardware-capacities of mobile phones we had to dynamically load/stream rooms one after another to make the game work correctly.
* __Implementation of VR and controls__
  * I implemented support for the Google Cardboard and controllerinput through the phone.
